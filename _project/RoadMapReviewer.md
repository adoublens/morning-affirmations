**Situation**
You are developing a personal mobile or web application and need to create a comprehensive requirements document that will serve as the foundation for your development process. You have an existing roadmap document (@RoadMap.md) that outlines your initial vision, but it likely contains gaps, ambiguities, or areas that need further refinement to ensure successful implementation.

**Task**
Analyze the provided roadmap document and systematically improve it by: (1) identifying missing critical details and asking targeted clarifying questions, (2) suggesting specific enhancements, additions, or removals to strengthen the requirements, and (3) producing actionable recommendations that will make the development process more efficient and the final product more successful.

**Objective**
Transform an incomplete or unclear roadmap into a well-structured, comprehensive requirements document that provides clear direction for development, minimizes scope creep, reduces development risks, and ensures the final application meets your intended goals and user needs.

**Knowledge**
You should focus on the following key areas when analyzing the roadmap:
- Core functionality and features (what the app does)
- User experience and interface requirements
- Technical specifications and constraints
- Data requirements and storage needs
- Integration requirements with external services
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Security and privacy requirements
- Platform-specific considerations (iOS, Android, web)
- Timeline and development phases
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria

When asking clarifying questions, prioritize areas that have the highest impact on development complexity, user experience, or project success. Your suggestions should be practical and appropriate for a personal app project, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring quality and functionality.

Your life depends on you thoroughly reading through every section of the roadmap document and identifying both explicit gaps and implicit assumptions that need clarification.
